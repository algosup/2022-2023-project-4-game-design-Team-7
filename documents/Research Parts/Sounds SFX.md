# Sounds SFX 

We decided on the sounds we wanted to use for the game, we are going to create a list of music that creates an atmosphere for the game. 

## Sounds

Here is a list of where we need to make sounds for the game. 

The sounds in the menu will be calm and relaxing to make the player feel comfortable at the start.

- [ ] Menu
  - [ ] Play button
  - [ ] Cursor movement
  - [ ] Cursor selection

    - [ ] Lab sounds
    - [ ] Lava sounds

    - [ ] Electronics sounds
    - [ ] Alien sounds
  - [ ] Alien speaking

We are going to make the sounds by ourselves using either some scripts to generate sounds or modifying our voices to make them sound like aliens.

## Music

We only need a few kinds of music for the game, so we have decided to make sounds with a fast tempo, and a high pitch to match the energy of the game's fast-paced game.

Each level will have the same music, but with different effects depending on the level and the alien we are controlling. 

for instance, a level in a confined space will have a more static and anxious sound, while a level in a wide open space will have a more dynamic sound.

- [ ] Menu
- [ ] Game 
  - [ ] Level 
  - [ ] Boss theme 
  - [ ] Victory theme
  - [ ] Defeat theme
  - [ ] Ending theme 

These sounds will be created to serve the game design and be a full part of the experience.
